# Desire Path Radio Development Guidelines

## Styling
- Don't use `font-mono` class - it's already set globally on body in globals.css
- Use exclusively colors defined in `app/globals.css` (@theme block: grey1-grey6, brand-dpr-orange, brand-dpr-green, brand-dpr-gray)

## Dev Mode
- We use DevModeProvider to add borders to client components for spacing visualization during development
- Dev mode is toggled with the B key
- Add dev mode borders to client components using: `className={devMode ? 'border border-red-500' : ''}`

don't use transition-colors, I prefer if it just snaps to the new state

we're using supabase for metadata storage, and cloudflare r2 for object storage
